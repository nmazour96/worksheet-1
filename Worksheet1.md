Hope to get out of the course: further understanding of students' ways of thinking, especially approaches that differ from the computer science mindset; improved ability to help students strengthen their computation thinking; knowledge that students have finished the class with a better understanding of computer science and better able to incorporate computers into their fields of interest

Project ideas: interactive fiction; interactive music; tile-based video game; physics simulation; multilingual social media with translation aids, minimal CAD interface for a 3D printer

Hope to get out of the course: basic coding skills to better help me understand the programs I will be working with later in my career. I also hope to gain a different way of thinking that will help me other subjects as well.
